# Tracks
Tracks is a sample application that uses the Pastry framework.

*The code in this repository was written in 2009 and has been refreshed in 2022.*

## What is Pastry?
Pastry is a tiny MVC framework written in PHP. It is inspired by [Apache Tapestry](https://tapestry.apache.org), a web framework written in Java. Pastry is based on components and manages data binding between the controllers and the interface. It strongly relies on the PHP DOM API.

## So what is Tracks?
I never released Pastry as a standalone package. Instead, I wrote this demo website called Tracks using the framework. This web application allows a logged user to easily search a track among a library of music files, then listen to it and give it a review.
